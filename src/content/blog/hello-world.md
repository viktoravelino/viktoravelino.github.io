Welcome to my blog! I'm Viktor Avelino, a Software Engineer currently working at IBM. I'm passionate about building modern web applications and sharing what I learn along the way.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a space where I share my thoughts on:

- **Frontend Development** — React patterns, TypeScript tips, and UI best practices
- **Software Architecture** — Lessons learned from building scalable applications
- **Career Growth** — Insights from my journey as a software engineer
- **Tools & Workflow** — Productivity tools and development setups I find useful

## A Bit About Me

I started my career in Brazil building full-stack applications, from a ride-sharing app with React Native to content management systems. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on enterprise-level projects at companies like Tech Mahindra and IBM, building everything from Point of Sale systems to design system component libraries.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and always strive to learn something new. Whether it's exploring a new framework or diving deeper into software design patterns, there's always something exciting happening in the world of web development.
